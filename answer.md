- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

Express is a middleware and it runs on node.

- [ ] Describe Middleware?

- [ ] Describe a Resource?

Secrets? not sure what this question is referring to but I think it would be the credentials to your api thatyou do not want to deploy that way hackers can break into your app.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

status codes?

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications? We can separate routes for each part of the database into its own filebase.
